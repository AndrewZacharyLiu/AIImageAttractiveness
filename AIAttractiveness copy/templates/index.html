<h1>Welcome to the AI Art test</h1>
<p>In this following test, you will have 10 seconds to judge a pair of artworks, one created by an AI and one by a real person. The two artworks will compete to captivate your attention. Using an eye tracker, the website will judge which art you have look at for the longest.</p>
